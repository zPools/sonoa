The SONO project is an endeavor created and managed by young entrepreneurs who wish to spread the word of cryptocurrency and fulfill the potential decentralized currencies can bring.
The SONO project is an aggregate of multiple teams working on an entire ecosystem that will make it possible for your average member of society to learn and understand what cryptocurrency is and what it is able to offer.

## SonoA

**SonoA** is a hashing algorithm, developed by zPools. It hash through 17 SHA3 candidates. Other than other x-styled algorithm, it may use a algorithm more than one time.
Following algorithm are used within SonoA:

- blake
- bmw
- groestl
- jh
- keccak
- skein
- luffa
- cubehash
- shavite
- simd
- echo
- hamsi
- fugue
- shabal
- whirlpool
- sha2
- haval

It is inspired by X11 and X17, but unlike x11, it is not mineable by ASICS. 
We can't promise it will never be mineable with ASIC, because the development of those are very advanced. But it should withstand them a while. 

SonoA is a perfect compromise between secure hashing and still delivering enough hashrate to maintain a 30 sec blocktime.
